<h1>B00080699 | The Awakening</h1>
<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
<p>Things didn't felt the same from a long time...Everything started to falling apart. I couldn't help it. Everyday
it got worst. I was walking trough the park. It didn't matter where I looked, everything was fading. No people in the park.
I was alone.</p>
