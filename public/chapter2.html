<h1>B00080699 | The Awakening</h1>
<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
<p>I ran in the direction of the gun shot. My heart started beating faster, I started sweating.
    I didn’t know what was coming.
    All I knew that there was a chance that somebody is still alive. I’ve reached the alley where the sound came from.
    The body was lying on the ground, in a pool of blood. It was a woman. She was about thirty years old. She was dead.
    She had long blond hair, blue jeans and a red leather jacket which had a bullet wound just right at the height of her heart. </p>
